CalendarBuilder
===============

CalendarBuilder does a couple things

* Builds calendars for the view
* Adds event finders to your event models

== Building Calendars

Add docs here. Please.

== Event Finders

Assuming you have an event model with some sort of begin_at and end_at, you can use all these finders:

Event.upcoming
Event.on_date(date)
Event.in_month(date)
Event.in_date_range(date1..date2)
Event.in_rolling_month(date, number_of_weeks)
Event.in_month_with_outliers(date)

== ToDo

* Extract CSS classes into options (month, day, weekend, other_month)
